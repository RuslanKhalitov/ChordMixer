This is the experiment setup we used to report models' performance in our paper.

Experiment consists of three tasks:

- (*adding*) Adding Problem with sequences with variable length
- (*genbank*) DNA-based taxonomy classification
- (*longdoc*) Long Documents Classifications

The adding and genbank tasks consist of sublevels. The base sequence length for adding (200, 1000, 16000, and 128000) and specific genuses for genbank (Sus vs. Bos, Danio vs. Cyprinus, Mus vs. Rattus, and Carassius vs. Labeo). The longdoc task is unique.
